# Gender-Inequality---Olympics-
The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. With the competitions happening every four years, these games regularly draw global audiences in the billions to watch coverage of athletes from hundreds of nations. 

Having been founded in 1894, the games were mainly  reserved for male athletes. It is only in the 1900 that women started being admitted as participants but excluded from showpiece events of track and field. In an effort to combat the effects of gender, the presence of women in every sport was made mandatory from the year 2007 leading to an increase in the rate of participation of women in the games. 

As improvements in gender equality in sports continue to be made a representation of 50% needs to be achieved. This research therefore seeks to analyse the participation of women in Olympic Games over the years.
